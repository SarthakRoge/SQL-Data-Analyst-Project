# SQL-Data-Analyst-Project

 Data Analyst Project – Bookstore Database
 
•	We worked with three CSV files: Books.csv, Customers.csv, and Orders.csv.
•	These were imported into PostgreSQL to create three tables: Books, Customers, and Orders.
•	The tables are connected through common columns (Book_ID and Customer_ID).
•	The Books table stores book details (title, author, genre, price, stock).
•	The Customers table stores customer details (name, email, phone, city, country).
•	The Orders table links books and customers through purchase transactions.
•	We performed Basic Queries for simple retrieval and filtering.
•	We performed Advanced Queries for deeper insights and analytics.
